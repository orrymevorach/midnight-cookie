      'We’ve all been there. It’s midnight, and you’re craving something sweet. Unable to sleep due to {insert disastrous world event here}, you start scrolling through your favourite food delivery app. To your surprise, every purveyor of fresh baked goods in the city has closed for the evening. There’s your run of the mill fast food options, but nothing made fresh. When Emily Banks and Alon Steinbach were faced with a situation much like this in early 2021, they decided to take matters into their own hands. Fed up with the lack of late-night options, the partners started Midnight Cookie. With delivery times from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. Tuesday through Thursday and 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. from Friday to Sunday, Midnight Cookie is baking delectable cookies when you want them the most. “We spent months crafting the perfect cookie,” Banks said. “They have crunchy edges with a soft centre, and are always delivered warm.” ',
